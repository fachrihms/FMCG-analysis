Domain Knowledge and Business Recommendations:

- Monday, the first day of work, usually the first day of work with a holiday atmosphere, so some of them need coffee to add energy, based on the results of data analysis, beverages or drinks are the product category with the most sales.

So the business recommendation here is to add coffee variants or add coffee stock so that people are more interested in buying coffee and also increase beverage sales volume by 10%

- Thursday, the fourth day of work, people have started to get used to the routine on weekdays, so they tend to buy snacks, either for themselves or to share with their co-workers.

So the business recommendation here is to increase the stock of snacks so that there is no shortage and then carry out a purchase strategy in a bundle with other products that have the least sales volume, namely beverages or drinks, so that revenue can be effective by increasing low beverage sales on Thursdays and increasing snack sales.

### Show current stock levels per product category

Insight:
